# ü•∫ Pretty Gnome
This is a small script that will copy the original Yaru theme, and add some changes to it with custom css to make transparent windows.<br>
On top of that it will rewrite the ~/.config/gtk-4.0 and 3.0 gtk.css files to the corresponding theme you selected ( Black or White )<br>

# üß© Extensions
You will need [user-themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/)<br>
This theme was made with the [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) extension in mind, without it it wil look like crap.<br><br>

# üö® Warning
Sometimes the window managment buttons may look bad, i see this behaviour only for Chrome, but it's worth to mention.<br><br>
